<p>All dependencies of the package. This option should be set by the "outer world" and can be used to inherit attributes from <code>pkgs</code> or <code>inputs</code> etc.</p>
<p>By separating the task of retrieving things from the outside world, it is ensured that the dependencies are overridable.
Nothing will stop users from adding <code>nixpkgs</code> itself as a dependency, but this will make it very hard for the user of the package to override any dependencies, because they'd have to figure out a way to insert their changes into the Nixpkgs fixpoint. By adding specific attributes to <code>deps</code> instead, the user has a realistic chance of overriding those dependencies.</p>
<p>So deps should be specific, but not overly specific. For instance, the caller shouldn't have to know the version of a dependency in order to override it. The name should suffice. (e.g. <code>nix = nixVersions.nix_2_12</code> instead of <code>inherit (nixVersions) nix_2_12</code>.</p>
