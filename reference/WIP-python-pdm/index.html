<p>Whether the pyproject format should be used. When set to <code>true</code>,
<code>pypaBuildHook</code> will be used, and you can add the required build dependencies
from <code>build-system.requires</code> to <code>build-system</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the pyproject format falls back to using <code>setuptools</code>, so
you can use <code>pyproject = true</code> even if the package only has a <code>setup.py</code>.
When set to <code>false</code>, you can use the existing hooks or provide your own
logic to build the package. This can be useful for packages that don't
support the pyproject format.</p>
<p>When unset, the legacy <code>setuptools</code> hooks are used for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>All dependencies of the package. This option should be set by the "outer world" and can be used to inherit attributes from <code>pkgs</code> or <code>inputs</code> etc.</p>
<p>By separating the task of retrieving things from the outside world, it is ensured that the dependencies are overridable.
Nothing will stop users from adding <code>nixpkgs</code> itself as a dependency, but this will make it very hard for the user of the package to override any dependencies, because they'd have to figure out a way to insert their changes into the Nixpkgs fixpoint. By adding specific attributes to <code>deps</code> instead, the user has a realistic chance of overriding those dependencies.</p>
<p>So deps should be specific, but not overly specific. For instance, the caller shouldn't have to know the version of a dependency in order to override it. The name should suffice. (e.g. <code>nix = nixVersions.nix_2_12</code> instead of <code>inherit (nixVersions) nix_2_12</code>.</p>

<p>All dependencies of the package. This option should be set by the "outer world" and can be used to inherit attributes from <code>pkgs</code> or <code>inputs</code> etc.</p>
<p>By separating the task of retrieving things from the outside world, it is ensured that the dependencies are overridable.
Nothing will stop users from adding <code>nixpkgs</code> itself as a dependency, but this will make it very hard for the user of the package to override any dependencies, because they'd have to figure out a way to insert their changes into the Nixpkgs fixpoint. By adding specific attributes to <code>deps</code> instead, the user has a realistic chance of overriding those dependencies.</p>
<p>So deps should be specific, but not overly specific. For instance, the caller shouldn't have to know the version of a dependency in order to override it. The name should suffice. (e.g. <code>nix = nixVersions.nix_2_12</code> instead of <code>inherit (nixVersions) nix_2_12</code>.</p>

When set to <code>false</code>, you can use the existing hooks or provide your own

support the pyproject format.</p>

<p>All dependencies of the package. This option should be set by the "outer world" and can be used to inherit attributes from <code>pkgs</code> or <code>inputs</code> etc.</p>
<p>By separating the task of retrieving things from the outside world, it is ensured that the dependencies are overridable.
Nothing will stop users from adding <code>nixpkgs</code> itself as a dependency, but this will make it very hard for the user of the package to override any dependencies, because they'd have to figure out a way to insert their changes into the Nixpkgs fixpoint. By adding specific attributes to <code>deps</code> instead, the user has a realistic chance of overriding those dependencies.</p>
<p>So deps should be specific, but not overly specific. For instance, the caller shouldn't have to know the version of a dependency in order to override it. The name should suffice. (e.g. <code>nix = nixVersions.nix_2_12</code> instead of <code>inherit (nixVersions) nix_2_12</code>.</p>

<p>All dependencies of the package. This option should be set by the "outer world" and can be used to inherit attributes from <code>pkgs</code> or <code>inputs</code> etc.</p>
<p>By separating the task of retrieving things from the outside world, it is ensured that the dependencies are overridable.
Nothing will stop users from adding <code>nixpkgs</code> itself as a dependency, but this will make it very hard for the user of the package to override any dependencies, because they'd have to figure out a way to insert their changes into the Nixpkgs fixpoint. By adding specific attributes to <code>deps</code> instead, the user has a realistic chance of overriding those dependencies.</p>
<p>So deps should be specific, but not overly specific. For instance, the caller shouldn't have to know the version of a dependency in order to override it. The name should suffice. (e.g. <code>nix = nixVersions.nix_2_12</code> instead of <code>inherit (nixVersions) nix_2_12</code>.</p>

<h4 id="pdmsourceselector">pdm.sourceSelector<a class="headerlink" href="#pdmsourceselector" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A selector function which picks a source for a specific dependency
Python dependencies can have multiple possible sources, like for example:
  - requests-2.31.0.tar.gz
  - requests-2.31.0-py3-none-any.whl
The selector receives a list of possible sources and should return either a single source or null.</p>
